통해 인구의 밀집 정도를 파악 가능합니다. 무선 네트워크의 성능을 안정적으로 유지하고 인구 밀집도를 완화하기 위해, AI를 활용하여 특정 축제 지역 내의 인구 수를 예측하고자 합니다.\n","- 학습 데이터<br>\n","    : 무선 기지국 장비인 RU(Radio Unit)에서는 서비스 지역인 셀 내에 존재하는 단말들의 통계 데이터를 관리합니다. 본 데이터에서는 업링크/다운링크 데이터 크기 및 블록 오류율(BLER), 셀 내 평균 수신 신호 강도(RSSI) 및 사용자 단말 수 등의 각종 통계 정보가 5분 단위로 제공됩니다.\n","- 문제 구성 및 풀이 요령<br>\n","    : 축제 지역 근방 10곳의 기지국에서 축제 기간 전후에 해당하는 모든 타임스탬프에 대해 인구 수를 예측하는 회귀
